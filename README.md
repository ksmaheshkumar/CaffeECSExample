Trying to run Caffe on EC2

Now has complete instructions to configure an Ubuntu EC2 g-instance up to have Caffe and ffmpeg which is enough to create deep dream inception videos.
 
Good for applying:
 * https://github.com/google/deepdream
 * https://github.com/samim23/DeepDreamAnim

To use:
 *  Start an EC2 instance 
   * A g instance such as g2.8xlarge instance (cheaper if you go for spot instances)
   * OS: Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-5189a661 (Amazon's current offering)
   * Must go to instance details to make sure you have more storage (I used 64GB)
 *  Follow the many steps in steps.txt

An alternative is a ready to go Docker image (I have not tested this):
